In this project, I have had to create my own curriculum vitae on a website. For this I have used HTML and CSS language to be able to project my website on Google.

Target user profile:
This resume is modernized for people of any age and company. If it is true that in the hobbies section I put sports, then it would be more aimed at a Decathlon-type company.

Architecture:
To structure the resume I have been influenced by my friend's resume, we have the left part that would be personal information and the right part where my work and academic experience appears.

Visual Design:
In the color palette I have mainly used two (apart from black and white), a grayish blue and a beige color, because the combination between these two colors is modern and was my goal in this project.
